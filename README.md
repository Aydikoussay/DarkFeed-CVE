## What is DARKFEED?

DARKFEED is a pure terminal CVE intelligence tool built for senior penetration testers. It aggregates vulnerability data from multiple sources in real time, cross-references public exploits and Metasploit modules, hunts for PoC code on GitHub, and maps full exploit chains — all from a single Python script with no GUI required.

Built to answer one question fast: **"Is this target exploitable right now?"**

---

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| CVE keyword search | Query NVD for any product, technology, or keyword |
| CVE ID lookup | Full details for a specific CVE including vector, CWE, CPE |
| Service + version matching | Input a service name and version to find matching CVEs |
| Latest NVD feed | Real-time stream of the most recently published CVEs |
| **Exploit chain** | CVE → ExploitDB → Metasploit → GitHub PoC → Patch status |
| PoC hunter | Search GitHub for public proof-of-concept repositories |
| ExploitDB search | Cross-reference via `searchsploit` |
| Metasploit search | Check if an MSF module exists for the target |
| Patch status | Detect if a fix is available via NVD references |
| Export | Save results to TXT or JSON for reporting |
| Filters | Filter by severity, year, minimum CVSS score |

---

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone [https://github.com/Atrox/darkfeed.git](https://github.com/Aydikoussay/DarkFeed-CVE)
cd darkfeed

# Install dependencies (only requests)
pip install requests

# Run
python3 darkfeed.py
```

---

## Optional: API Keys (Recommended)

DARKFEED works without any API keys, but setting them removes rate limits.

### NVD API Key — removes NVD rate limit (free)
1. Go to https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key
2. Fill the form — you get the key by email in minutes
3. Set it:
```bash
export NVD_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

### GitHub Token — enables PoC hunter without limits (free)
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate a new token (classic) — no special scopes needed
3. Set it:
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-token-here"
```

To make them permanent, add both lines to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

---

## Optional: External Tools

These are not required but unlock additional features:

| Tool | Feature unlocked | Install |
|---|---|---|
| `searchsploit` | ExploitDB search | `sudo apt install exploitdb` |
| `msfconsole` | Metasploit module search | Install Metasploit Framework |

On Kali Linux, both are typically already installed.

---

## Usage

```
python3 darkfeed.py
```

```
  SEARCH
  [1] Keyword search              apache, log4j, vsftpd 2.3.4
  [2] CVE ID lookup               CVE-2021-44228
  [3] Service + version           openssh 7.4

  RECON
  [5] Exploit chain for CVE       CVE → EDB → MSF → PoC → Patch
  [6] PoC hunter (GitHub)         search PoC repos by keyword

  TOOLS
  [7] ExploitDB search
  [8] Metasploit search
  [9] Export last results         TXT or JSON
```
